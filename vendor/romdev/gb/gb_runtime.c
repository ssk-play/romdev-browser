/* ── OAM DMA - the HRAM-stub idiom (R55 fix) ────────────────────────
 *
 * The GB OAM DMA engine ($FF46) transfers 160 bytes from `$XX00` (high
 * byte set by the write) to OAM at $FE00-$FE9F. It takes ~160 µs
 * (~640 cycles) and during that window **the CPU can only access
 * HRAM ($FF80-$FFFE) + a couple of I/O registers**. Reads from ROM /
 * WRAM / VRAM during DMA return $FF on real hardware.
 *
 * The "$FF returned for instruction fetch" bug is nasty: $FF decodes
 * as `rst $38`, which CALLs $0038. gb_crt0.s vectors $0038 to a bare
 * `ret`, which pops the stack - but the stack just had the rst's
 * return address pushed, so we return to PC+1. Effectively the CPU
 * skips one byte. Eventually a misaligned fetch lands as the operand
 * of an earlier instruction and you jump into garbage. Common symptom:
 * LCDC silently flips to $FF (the byte the CPU "saw" off of ROM
 * during a DMA window for an unrelated I/O write), BG VRAM at
 * $9800-$9BFF gets a wild burst of zeros, etc. Many emulators (incl.
 * gambatte) don't enforce the DMA-bus-conflict rule strictly which is
 * why the broken pattern "worked" in light testing - but the bug
 * shows up under longer / different code paths (round 27).
 *
 * The canonical fix: install a tiny stub in HRAM that does the DMA
 * register write + spin + return, then CALL the HRAM stub. The stub
 * itself executes from HRAM (allowed during DMA), so the fetch never
 * hits ROM/WRAM. After the spin ends, control returns to wherever
 * called us and normal bus access resumes.
 *
 * HRAM stub (placed at $FF80):
 *   F0 46 / E0 46  ;   ldh ($46), a    - write DMA register (start)
 *   3E 28         ;   ld  a, 40        - spin counter (160 / 4 = 40)
 *   3D            ; - dec a
 *   20 FD         ;   jr  nz, -3       - back to dec a

 * shadow_oam mirrors hardware OAM ($FE00, 40 sprites × 4 bytes). Build
 * your sprite list here each frame, then call oam_dma_flush() in
 * vblank to push to the LCD.
 *
 * Hardware OAM byte layout per sprite:
 *   +0  Y position (real Y = this - 16; 0 hides, 16 = top of screen)
 *   +1  X position (real X = this - 8;  0 hides, 8  = left of screen)
 *   +2  Tile index
 *   +3  Attributes (palette / flip / priority / CGB palette + VRAM bank)
 *
 * Round 26 footgun fix: shadow_oam MUST be page-aligned. The OAM DMA
 * engine takes ONLY the high byte of the source address - it always
 * copies 160 bytes from `$XX00` to OAM. If shadow_oam happens to land
 * at e.g. $C017, oam_dma_copy(&shadow_oam) latches DMA = $C0 and the
 * hardware DMA's $C000..$C09F (NOT $C017..$C0B6). Result: silent
 * garbage in OAM, sprites never appear where you put them.
 *
 * We pin shadow_oam at $C100 with SDCC's `__at` attribute. WRAM is
 * 8 KB at $C000-$DFFF on DMG, so $C100..$C19F leaves $C000-$C0FF for
 * static initialisers + the first 256 bytes of stack growth, and the
 * gsinit region in gb_crt0.s lives in ROM. No conflict.
 *
 * If your game needs a custom OAM buffer location, declare your own
 * with `__at(0xCXYZ)` where Y in 0..F, ZX = 0, and pass it to
 * oam_dma_copy() directly. Whatever address you pick, the low byte
