/* ── platformer.c - Game Boy side-scrolling platformer (complete example game)
 *
 * GULLY GALLOP - a COMPLETE, working game: title screen, gravity + jump
 * physics with sub-pixel precision, one-way platforms, pits and spikes,
 * coins + distance scoring, persistent hi-score (battery cart RAM), music
 * + SFX, and the Game Boy's signature WINDOW-LAYER HUD: a fixed score/
 * lives strip that the SCX-scrolling level slides beneath, with zero
 * mid-frame raster tricks.
 *
 * THIS FILE IS MEANT TO BE FORKED AND MODIFIED into your own game - even a
 * very different one. The markers tell you what's what:
 *   HARDWARE IDIOM (load-bearing) - dodges a documented GB footgun; reshape
 *     your gameplay around it (see TROUBLESHOOTING before changing).
 *   GAME LOGIC (clay) - level layout, physics tuning, scoring, art: reshape
 *     freely.
 *
 * SINGLE-PLAYER BY DESIGN (the honest handheld story): the Game Boy has ONE
 * controller. Multiplayer on real hardware means the link cable, and a
 * single emulator instance cannot emulate a second Game Boy on the other
 * end of that cable - so this game ships 1P only instead of faking a 2P
 * mode the platform can't deliver. (Consoles' examples have real 2P.)
 *
 * What depends on what:
 *   gb_hardware.h - register names (LCDC/WX/WY/NRxx/...) + LCDC bit masks.
 *   gb_runtime.{h,c} - vblank wait (HALT-driven), joypad, shadow OAM +
 *     the OAM-DMA-from-HRAM routine, VRAM-safe memcpy, APU helpers.
 *   gb_crt0.s - boot + interrupt vectors + the cartridge header window.
 *     It DECLARES the cart as MBC1+RAM+BATTERY ($0147=$03, $0149=$02) -
 *     that declaration is what makes hiscore_save() below persist (the
 *     emulator sizes battery SAVE_RAM from those two header bytes).
 *     Load-bearing; edit with TROUBLESHOOTING open.
 *
 * The level: a 256-px-wide COLUMN MAP (ground height + one-way platforms +
 * pits) painted once into the wrapping 32-wide BG map, so the uint8 SCX
 * scroll wraps PERFECTLY seamless - an endless looping run of pits,
 * platforms, coins and spikes. Coins/spikes are sprites that drift with
 * the scroll (world-anchored while on screen, respawning at the right
 * edge). The camera is one-way (the classic runner camera): past the
 * scroll wall the world scrolls instead of the player.
 *
 * Frame budget (59.7 fps, ~17 556 machine cycles/frame, vblank = 10 of 154
 * lines ≈ 1 140 cycles): everything VRAM/OAM-touching below happens in the
 * vblank slice (OAM DMA ~165 cycles + ≤ 11 queued HUD/map bytes + one SCX
 * write); game logic (player physics, a two-column landing probe, 3 coins
 * + 2 spikes of AABB, staging 6 OAM slots) runs in the other 144 lines.
 * Comfortable.

/* ── HARDWARE IDIOM (load-bearing - reshape gameplay around this; see TROUBLESHOOTING) ──
 * THE WINDOW-LAYER HUD - the Game Boy's signature "fixed HUD over a
 * scrolling world" technique. The window is a second BG plane with its own
 * 32×32 tile map and NO scroll registers: it always draws its map from
 * (0,0), pinned to the screen, on top of the BG. So the HUD lives in the
 * window and the playfield lives in the BG - SCY/SCX scroll the world all
 * they like and the HUD never moves. No raster splits, no IRQ timing (the
 * NES needs a sprite-0 polling dance for this exact effect; on GB it's
 * three register writes). This game scrolls SCX (horizontal runner); the
 * shmup example scrolls SCY - same idiom, either axis.
 *
 * The three registers, and their two famous footguns:
 *   WY ($FF4A) - first screen LINE the window covers. We use 128: lines
 *     0-127 are playfield, 128-143 (two tile rows) are HUD.
 *   WX ($FF4B) - screen column PLUS SEVEN. WX=7 means "left edge". The
 *     -7 offset is hardware fact, not a library quirk: WX=0..6 glitches
 *     (real DMG pixel pipeline artifacts), WX≥167 pushes it off-screen.
 *   LCDC bit 5 - window enable; bit 6 - which map it reads ($9800/$9C00).
 *
 * FOOTGUN 1 - "the window ate the bottom of my screen": once the window
 * starts on a line it covers EVERY line from there DOWN, full width from
 * WX to the right edge. There is no window height register. That is why
 * GB HUDs sit at the BOTTOM of the screen (this game, and most of the
 * classic library). A TOP HUD needs a mid-frame trick - STAT-interrupt on
 * LYC, flip LCDC bit 5 off after the HUD rows - which is a different,
 * fragile idiom; don't drift into it by accident by setting WY=0.
 *
 * FOOTGUN 2 - sprites are NOT clipped by the window. OBJs draw on top of
 * it (priority bits notwithstanding), so a sprite that wanders below
 * line 128 sits ON the HUD. Gameplay keeps every object above PLAY_H
 * (spikes stand on the ground, coins float, and a player falling into a
 * pit dies at PLAY_H-8 - the frame before the sprite would touch the HUD).
 *
 * Requires: window map at $9C00 (LCDC bit 6 set - keeps it separate from
 * the BG's $9800 map), tile data at $8000 (LCDC bit 4), WX=7, WY=PLAY_H,
 * LCDC bit 5 set during play (title turns the window off - LCDC bit
 * discipline lives in the two LCDC_* values below, poke those, not LCDC). */

 * BATTERY SRAM - persistent hi-score. MBC1 cart RAM is 8KB at $A000-$BFFF,
 * but it boots DISABLED and writes to a disabled bank are silently
 * discarded (reads float). The gate is the MBC's RAM-enable register: any
 * WRITE to ROM space $0000-$1FFF with $0A in the low nibble enables the
 * RAM; writing $00 disables it again. (Writing "into ROM" feels wrong the
 * first time - ROM-area writes never touch ROM, they're how you talk to
 * the mapper chip.) Leaving RAM enabled all the time "works" in emulators
 * but on real hardware risks corruption at power-off - battery carts since
 * forever do enable → touch → disable, so we do too.
 *
 * The record is magic 'H','S' + score lo,hi + a checksum byte, so a
 * first-boot cart full of $FF garbage reads as "no record" instead of a
 * 65535 hi-score.
 *
 * Requires: gb_crt0.s declaring $0147=$03 (MBC1+RAM+BATTERY) + $0149=$02
 * (8KB) - those header bytes are how the emulator knows to allocate and
 * persist SAVE_RAM. Verify headlessly: play, game over, then
 * memory({op:'read', region:'save_ram'}) shows the block, and the

   *      stub into HRAM ($FF80). During OAM DMA the CPU can only fetch
   *      from HRAM; the broken alternative (spinning in ROM) fetches $FF
   *      = rst $38 and corrupts the stack - the classic "sprites never
   *      show / game dies after a while" GB death. Every oam_dma_flush()
   *      below depends on this stub existing.
   *   2. enable_vblank_irq() - flips wait_vblank() from LY-polling to
   *      HALT-until-vblank-IRQ. The polling fallback runs at ~1/30 speed
   *      on the WASM emulator; the HALT path is full speed everywhere.
   *   3. LCD off (inside vblank) for the bulk VRAM uploads - tiles, font,
   *      first screen - then back on. VRAM is only freely writable with
   *      the LCD off or during vblank/hblank windows. */

     *     over time) slides it into active display, where the PPU is

     *     and miserable to debug.
     *   commit_vram() second - the few queued HUD/map bytes.
     *   SCX last - scroll latches per-scanline, so writing it during
     *     vblank (before line 0 renders) moves the WHOLE next frame
     *     consistently; the window ignores it by design (the HUD idiom).

     * flags and shadow OAM, and this slice commits them. Keep that split
     * when you reshape the game. */
